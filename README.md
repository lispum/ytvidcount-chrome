# Video Counter for YouTube
Show author's video count with a direct link to all videos on the YouTube watch page. Without having to hover over the name.

## Installing
On your own responsibility.

This is an unpacked, unsigned chrome extension.

1. Download the zip with the release.
2. Unpack it to somewhere it can stay for long time.
3. In `chrome://extensions` check *Developer mode* on the top
4. Click the *Load unpacked extension* button
5. In the folder chooser, choose the *dist* folder from the unpacked zip. For example if you unpacked the zip to `../Downloads/YTVidCount-Chrome-master/...` then choose `.../Downloads/YTVidCount-Chrome-master/dist/`

Next you will have to set up an App in your Google Developer console with a YouTube Data API, create App credentials and paste your API Key secret to extension options.

More detailed instructions soon.

## Plans
I plan to find a better solution to the API problem, suggestions welcome.
