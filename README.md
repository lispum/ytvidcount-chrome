# Video Counter for YouTube
Show author's video count with a direct link to all videos on the YouTube watch page. Without having to hover over the name.

## Installing
On your own responsibility.

This is an unpacked, unsigned chrome extension.

1. Download the zip with the [newest release](https://github.com/lispum/ytvidcount-chrome/releases), alternatively the zip of the whole repository.
2. Unpack it to somewhere it can stay for long time.
3. In `chrome://extensions` check *Developer mode* on the top
4. Click the *Load unpacked extension* button
5. In the folder chooser, choose the *dist* folder from the unpacked zip. For example `./Downloads/YTVidCount-Chrome-master/dist/`

Next you will have to set up an App in your Google Developer console with a YouTube Data API, create App credentials and paste your API Key secret to extension options.

More detailed instructions soon.

## Plans
I plan to find a better solution to the API problem, suggestions welcome.
